#Flashcard App for English School Classes

#What it is
This application provides vocabulary flashcards and and a matching game for Japanese students learning English.

Every week the key vocabulary from the school's classes will be added to a database. This vocabulary will then be available on the app for students to review.

#Why I chose Next JS
I chose Next JS as it has a built in backend api and I could deploy it easily using Vercel.

#Future Ideas
I hope to create an individual login for each student so that they can save the flashcards that they are having difficulty with into their own private deck for review.
